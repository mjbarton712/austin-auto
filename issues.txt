✅ When I click on a new car, it default picks existing vehicle. I want it to pick new vehicle by default.

✅ Can we change the look of the buttons when they are selected? It looks like existing vehicle is clicked when really new vehicle is picked

✅ The drop down for the car text and chevron is black and hard to see and doesn't say "Vehicle Information" with the little car icon like the other accordions have. Can you style it like those?
✅ Hourly rate in the job section should be read only, and only calculated if the hours spent, amount charged, and cost to fix are all filled in.

✅ In the mobile view, I would like the statuses in the job tables to stack vertically to condense them and save space.

✅ Looks like on the dashboard, the currently in shop and coming soon job tables do not have any search bar but there should be one there.

✅ When the date/calendar input fields are in focus, they are white, which is not good. Would rather have a different color, either neutral or matching the color scheme.
✅ Update job to the same format as car for the "optional" flag with the same style; remove the asterisk from the required since the optional ones will have the little note next to them
✅ Can I sort by column in the garage table or job tables?
✅ Light mode :)

✅ I have noticed an annoying behavior with many input fields. If I start to type something in and then remove it, it doesn't let me remove it, but has a 0. Then if I try to type in again, the 0 is still at the front. And if I type a letter on accident it blanks out the number that was there and turns it into a 0. Would like that it behaved like other fields instead where you can clear it out and maybe if a letter is typed it just does nothing. This is the case with the following number fields:
In job:
mileage, cost to fix, amount charged, hours spent
In car:
year
I also get this error which might be related?

✅ When trying to submit it fails:
@supabase_supabase-js.js?v=1d6edede:3778 
 POST https://cffpowuluoctfuifcznq.supabase.co/rest/v1/cars_new?columns=%22id%22%…type%22%2C%22oil_type%22%2C%22vin%22%2C%22jobs%22%2C%22user_id%22&select=* 400 (Bad Request)
car-details.tsx:234 Submission error: 
{code: 'PGRST204', details: null, hint: null, message: "Could not find the 'jobs' column of 'cars_new' in the schema cache"}

✅ I used to have a notification when I submit and things were successful, and the page would show that the submission or update was successful, and then two buttons to go back to dashboard or to edit the entry. Can you help me set that up again for car-details? Likewise, when there is something wrong, I would like a little popup by the submit button at the bottom that says there are errors I need to fix - can you help me set that up as well? Would like it to be setup intuitively for the code structure, so think through where to add it and how best to add it if we need to make changes in the future.

✅ If I go in to edit a car, and save, it doesn't save the changes I made to the database like i would want it to for the car or the job object; instead, right now, I get a message on optional fields like "Expected string, received null" or "Expected number, received null" - looks like a validation issue. Can you fix this so that if I go into an existing record in car-details and then save changes, it will save them to the database and give a notification that things were saved like mentioned above (or that there were errors that need to be fixed if that is the case)?

✅ I would like an easy way to remove a job if the user added a job accidentally on car-details. Something intuitive, modern looking, and slick. If it was just something added that was never saved, just remove it, otherwise if was something that was attached to the car in the database, give a confirmation popup that we can delete the job, then delete it from the database if they confirm, and give the user a small notification that the record was removed. 


⚠️ The Job titles need to be cut off at a certain point for the description - how about 40 characters?

❌ When I pick an existing car, it does not load that existing car's details in, including the values for the car object as well as the jobs (and their photos)

Photos don't work - permission issue guessing? they used to work
