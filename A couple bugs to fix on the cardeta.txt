Test for bugs
_________

- Should partial payment not be an option? otherwise need more info on that. 
- In history should have a not yet paid section for the completed cars that just are pending payment


- Top header is smooshed - update "add car" to just be '+' on mobile/ small width page. Search bar should expand when you click in it on mobile. Looks like sign out is ruining the layout? Not sure.
- Background doesn't fully extend on phone. add car page, dashboard, history - all of those have the same issue.

Bigger projects
- Finish history page
- Make the search actually work (get rid of search?)

- Add intake page, client facing (with captcha)
- Add professional invoice, structured and printable
- OAuth setup google with multiple accounts possible
